# Security Policy

Please note that I only support the most recent version of this package.

If you believe to have found a vulnerability in sha3-d, I strongly advise you
to draft a new security advisory by clicking **Report a vulnerability**.

If GitHub is not alright with you, you can always reach me in others ways
[found in my portfolio](https://dd86k.github.io/#additional).
